Data Analysis Project Summary 
================================

My data analysis projects seeks to analyze an e-commerce data set from Kaggle.com. 
This data set describes all transactions between January, 2010 and September, 2011 for an online retail store in the UK, with 541909 observations and eight variables describing each transaction. 
The reason I want to analyze this data is because I have always had an interest in learning about e-commerce, and I believe that analyzing this e-commerce data will provide
me with valuable information if I am ever to start my own e-commerce business in the future. Various ways to analyze this data are available, such as exploratory data analysis, time series analysis, and classification, to name a few. I think
that analyzing this data will be very informative and insightful.
